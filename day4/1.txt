 1. Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
Feature	Supervised Learning	Unsupervised Learning
🎯 Goal	Predict target/output variable	Discover hidden patterns
✅ Has labels?	Yes (labeled data)	No (unlabeled data)
🧠 Learns from	Input-output pairs	Input features only
🧪 Example Tasks	Classification, Regression	Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
📘 Example Dataset	Diabetes dataset with Outcome	Customer data with no labels
🧑‍🏫 Analogy	Teacher supervising learning	No teacher; self-learning

 2. Classification vs Clustering
Feature	Classification 🧾	Clustering 🧊
Belongs to	Supervised learning	Unsupervised learning
Labels available?	Yes (e.g., spam vs not spam)	No (groups are discovered)
Goal	Assign inputs to predefined classes	Group similar items automatically
Output	Class labels (discrete)	Cluster labels (arbitrary)
Evaluation metric	Accuracy, F1, ROC-AUC, etc.	Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin, etc.
Example	Predicting diabetes (0 or 1)	Segmenting customers into types

Task	Classification or Clustering?
Predict whether a passenger survived Titanic	Classification ✅
Group customers by shopping behavior	Clustering ✅
Email spam detection	Classification ✅
Group news articles by topic (unsupervised)	Clustering ✅

Comparison	Classification	Clustering
Learning type	Supervised	Unsupervised
Output	Predefined classes	Discovered clusters
Input labels	Required	Not required
Goal	Learn mapping to labels	Learn structure in data
